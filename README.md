## How Duels Work
1. To challenge someone, walk up and **Flourish (X + 1)**.
2. If they Flourish back, the duel begins **after both Flourishes are complete**.
3. No interfering with an ongoing duel, don‚Äôt block, bump, or stand in the way.
4. If you‚Äôre not dueling, stay clear of the active fight area.
5. After the fight, heal and re-equip **outside the duel space**.
