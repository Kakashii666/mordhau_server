## How Duels Work
1. Join the line and wait your turn.
2. Step into an empty ring when free.
3. **Start the duel with a Flourish:** press `X` then `1`. Your opponent does the same.
4. Fight begins **after both** have flourished.
5. Winner stays, next challenger steps in.

### Starting a Duel (Flourish)
- Face your opponent at a safe distance.
- Press `X` ‚Üí `1` to perform a **Flourish**.
- Wait for your opponent to Flourish back.
- No hits until both Flourishes are done. Then‚Ä¶ fight! üó°Ô∏è
